In the lesson, we learnt that when you see an advert you must analyse it and check whether everything they are saying is true. This does not only apply to adverts but medias such as the BBC. Moreover, you must see what target market that commercial is set for and this can be done by using the actions of the actors in it. For example something fancy and popular could be set for young adults. Next is that the media will have an unseen point that is trying to be made for their specific target market. The media's might be giving a biased opinion on something or the companies will try to sell something that has the incorrect information. This links to my final point which is that they might be missing out some information to give their view or to sell more products.
