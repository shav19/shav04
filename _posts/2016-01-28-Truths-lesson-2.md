In this lesson we learnt that you must research facts on the internet on media articles to see if what they are writing is true. Also you need to realise what is true and what is not in that advert. Another point is that other people must not change your views on what you believe. Also people on reality shows might act differently than they normally do because they know this is public and products from companies might be changed because they will use editing computers to change it to what they will think will make it look good.
