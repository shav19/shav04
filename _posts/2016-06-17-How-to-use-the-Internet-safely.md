This week we learnt a lot on how to cope with issues on the internet. For example, if we are sent a pornographic picture, which is considered bad to be sent one, we must immediately tell the teachers. If you hold this evidence without telling a trusted adult you could be in trouble with the police and your parents. Mr Keen also said that we must not,obviously, be sending rude messages to each other.
