Isaac Newton

Isaac Newton was born on Christmas day at Woolsthorpe Manor in Lincolnshire. When he was born his father had died three months earlier. His father was a very rich farmer but his son did not share the same passion. Isaac hated farming. He was educated at King's school in Grantham and became the best student due to his models of sundials and windmills. He went to Trinity School in Cambridge in 1661. When Newton gave his theories on light and colour to the Royal society they could not understand it because there wasn't enough information to prove it. As an adult he experienced different stages. From politics to being a mathematician and then becoming the head of the Royal Society. When becoming the head of the Royal Society he tried to eliminate his rivals and enemies such as Robert Hooke. He tragically died on March 20th,1727 at the age of 84.

Isaacs law of motions

1. When something is moving at a speed it will go at the same speed unless a force from the outside does something to change it.

2. It takes more power from any force to move a larger object.

3. When a body exerts force on a another body the second body will exert an equal force back to the first body.
