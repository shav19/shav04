Creating the identity map was a very fun thing to do apart from the fact that I did the wrong things and therefore I felt quite stupid when I was sharing with the class. This is because I only remembered this morning from others in my class that you had to do lots of writing on the map to receive a good grade. However I felt good on reading other people's identity map because it would be interesting to read (which it was) and seeing their designs. But talking to them face-to-face could be better because then they will go into depth and say it in a way that is clear to you. Most comments did not surprise me because I knew that I had forgot to add more writing. But on the bright side they were comments for me to improve on next time. Variation between this and online posting is that you know they are not lying whereas on social media,they might try to cover up their true identity. On social media I would like to only share shareable information and only give vague information on where I live. These six lessons made me understand on how adverts are structured and their target audience. Also they made me think about whether everything a media says is true. In the future I intend to use social media, as I do not use it now, and this impacted on that because now I know how to use it safely and know who or what to trust.
