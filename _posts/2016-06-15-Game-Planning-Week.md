This week we did a survey on our electronic devices and how we use them. For example it questioned any limits set by parents; how long we used it; what pornography is and many more. I wasn't feeling scared because I have never done anything unsuitable using devices.  However, more importantly, we learnt we were going to do a planning document for a game on our microbits. We were allowed to go in pairs but we both have to have a fair share of the work and create it separately. Michael and I have decided to create a game similar to "Bop it â€œ except we will be calling it ' Shake It". Also we did to to do three separate tutorials on the Microbit. Personally I found these ones much easier than a couple of other ones.
