This week we looked at a similar app to Powerpoint. It is called Prezi and when I tested it out, it seemed quite cool. There seemed to be more visual effects than Powerpoint and you could cleverly place your slides. However it was quite difficult to use slides because you had to create them however you could use different shapes.
