This week we looked at different tutorials on Javascript. It was frustrating when I tried to to do the extension for Roll the Dice and it didn't work. Furthermore Mr Keen didnâ€™t approve that we were following instructions whereas we should be trying to make our own code. This means that I would have found it incredibly challenging on making the code by myself. Because I was stuck on Roll the Dice I had to do the other tutorials at home.
