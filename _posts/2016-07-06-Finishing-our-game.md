This week I learnt that you should do your homework even if the teacher does not look at it as they will mark it later. In the lesson we were finishing off our games. I learnt that there must be a large amount of coding and you need to think of all the possible outcomes. In the weekend I managed to reach the target of 15 blog posts and therefore that links with my first sentence..
