These two weeks we looked at how to operate a microbit. In the first week we fiddled around with it and went on tutorials to see how different programming languages work. It was quite simple and very easy for the Microsoft code but I found Java script harder.This week we designed the code for a technological Harry Potter Sorting hat. When we had to create the code by ourselves I found it a challenge. This is because I am used to copying off the teacher but not thinking for myself and therefore I struggled slightly. However I managed to accomplish the task.
