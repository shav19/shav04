In this lesson we learnt the positives and negatives of social media. For example, you look at business jobs or the latest famous subjects. However you can use it in the bad way which is grooming or kidnapping. We also learnt that some posts are more bad than others. For example you could say that your are the only person in the house. Additionally you could post pictures of you on holiday.
