This week we started our own game on the microbit. I thought it would be easy but Michael made it sound difficult when he said my code was incorrect. Maybe next time I should read through all the code and use that technique Mr Keen taught us. I also learnt that I needed to do all the blog posts because our attainment grades would be affected by that. Now I learnt my lesson on leaving homework to the last night.
