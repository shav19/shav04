In this week we continued our tutorials. As usua,l I struggled with the microbit but I decided to work together with Arvin Joy for one of the tutorials extension. It was a painstakingly long process but in the end we managed to find the outcome. It shows that you must never give up to find the outcome. However we had to complete even more challenging tutorials for homework that made you think even more. Also Mr Keen told us that if we are struggling, we should look away from the computer and write out the code on paper to understand it.
